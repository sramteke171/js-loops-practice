/*
 * PART 1: for loops
 */

/*
 * Prompt:
 *
 * Write a for loop that counts from 0 to 5, printing each number to the
 * console.
 */

/*
 * Prompt:
 *
 * Write a for loop that counts down from 5 to 0, printing each number to the
 * console.
 */

/*
 * Prompt:
 *
 * Write a for loop that counts from 0 to 10 in increments of 2, printing each
 * number to the console.
 */

/*
 * Prompt:
 *
 * Write a for loop that counts from -5 to 5, printing each number to the
 * console.
 */

/*
 * Prompt:
 *
 * Create a variable called sum (make sure sum is defined outside of your loop).
 * Create a loop that counts from 1 to 10, incrementing by 1. This time, rather
 * than printing i to the console, add i to sum. After your loop, print the
 * value of sum to the console.
 *
 * Reflect: What did we just do here?
 */

/*
 * Prompt:
 *
 * We can write any valid JavaScript inside the block of our loop (the part
 * between the curly braces). Let's put a conditional in there!
 *
 * Create a loop that counts from 0 to 10. Inside your loop, write a conditional
 * that matches these requirements:
 *
 *    - if the value of i is even, print out "i is event"
 *    - otherwise, print out "i is odd"

/*
 * PART 2: Iterating through Arrays
 */

/*
 * Prompt:
 *
 * Write a for loop that prints out each item in the below array.
 */

const letters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g'];

/*
 * Prompt:
 *
 * Write a for loop that sums the values in the below array.
 */

const numbers = [23, 19, 23, 52, 12];

/*
 * PART 3: while loops
 */

/*
 * Prompt:
 *
 * Use a while loop to count from 0 to 10.
 */

/*
 * Prompt:
 *
 * Use the prompt function to write a while loop that will continue to ask the
 * user for the magic number until they enter the number 7.
